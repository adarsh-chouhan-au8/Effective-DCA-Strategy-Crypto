# Effective-DCA-Strategy-Crypto

This script allows you to backtest a DCA (Dollar-cost averaging) strategy for the historical data of different coins. It gives you the percentage ROI (return on investment) for each year. 

The algorithm goes by buying and selling on fixed levels of price and a fixed percentage drop, to which the code will active buy and sell. The number of levels of price depends on the percentage drop and the percentage levels of price at which you are selling.
